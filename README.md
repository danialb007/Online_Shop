Simple E-Commerce created with django.
# Features:
    Creating user accoutns
    Loging in and out
    Adding and removing items to/from cart
    Changing the count if items in the cart
    Submiting reviews and ratings

# Notes:
    I didn't include the settings.py file since nothing is really changed in there.
    I used postgresql database to handle the backend models but you can use other databases if you like, But make sure you configure your database settings in settings.py

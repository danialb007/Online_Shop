# Docs:
    Simple E-Commerce created with django.
# Features:
    Creating user accoutns
    Loging in and out
    Adding and removing items to/from cart
    Changing the count if items in the cart
    Submiting reviews and ratings

# Notes:
    I didn't include the settings.py file since nothing is really changed in there.
    I used postgresql database to handle the backend models but you can use other databases if you like,
    but make sure you configure your database settings in settings.py.
    I also included a simple "sql_test_products.txt" file and you can
    copy paste it's lines into your sql based database to add some products.
